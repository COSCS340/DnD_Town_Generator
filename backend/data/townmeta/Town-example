 This is a basic look at what an output may look like, obviously with large population lists the people list will need to be searchable.
 Also there may be other fields to add later, if we intend to generate a map then each person will need a field for residence and place 
 of work.
 
Basically, there are for major catagories of what we're supplying to the user: Town Meta, Personal Meta, Town Events, Personal Events.
town events are what produce the town meta, while personal events will produce personal meta. Also all people will have personal events
that correspond to each town event.
