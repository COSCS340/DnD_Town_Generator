I think text files should have the following form:

EVENT:  [EVENT NAME]
CONSEQUENCE: [EVENT CONSIQUENCE] [[COMPATIBILITY LIST]] [PERCENT CHANCE] [CHANGING CODE]
REACTION: [POSSIBLE REACTION OF AN NPC TO AN EVENT] [CHANGING CODE]

there may be zero or more consquences or reactions to a given event.
Not sure how we should parse or do the changing codes, that'll be something to think about once we're implementing more in depth.

example

EVENT: RED DRAGON ATTACK  
CONSEQUENCE: CITY DESTROYED AND FULLY REBUILT [1] 20%
CONSEQUENCE: CITY DESTROYED AND PARTILLY REBUILT [1] 75% BREAK "CITY" 40
CONSEQUENCE: RED DRAGON KILLED IN CITY [2] 10% 
CONSEQUENCE: THE DRAGON IS PAID TO LEAVE THE CITY IN PEACE [2] 10% ADD "DRAGON" NEAR
CONSEQUENCE: THE DRAGON LEAVES ON ITS OWN [2] 60% ADD "DRAGON" NEAR
CONSEQUENCE: THE DRAGON RULES THE CITY NOW [2] 20% CHANGE RULER "DRAGON"
REACTION: HID IN THE BASEMENT [3] 80%
REACTION: FOUGHT THE DRAGON [3] 30%
REACTION: FLED THE CITY, BUT RETURNED [3] 56%
REACTION: FLED TO ANOTHER CITY [3] 20% MOVE_NPC CITY NEAR
